# LearningHuman

This repository aims to provide code snippets and examples for common human motion utilities, for example, varies kinds of motion expression from skeletons to parameters models.

## Preparation

### Environment

```shell
conda create -n lh python=3.8
conda activate lh

pip install -r requirements.txt  # install the required packages
pip install -e .                 # install the local package
```

### Data

Some notebooks may need some extra data downloaded from the internet. They can be checkpoints of models or datasets or something else. The instruction of how to download them will be provided in notebooks that need them.

## Usage

The support codes are placed in `lib` folder. They are mainly some utility functions for visualization or logging or data organization or something else. You can just ignore them if you are not interested in them.

All the snippets are in the jupyter notebooks under the `notebooks` folder.

Here is the recommended order to read the notebooks if you are totally new to this field:

1. [Rotation Representation](notebooks/rotation_representation.ipynb)
2. \(üõ†Ô∏è *WIP*\) [Skeletons](notebooks/skeletons.ipynb)
3. [SMPL Basic](notebooks/SMPL_basic.ipynb)
4. SMPLH Basic
5. [SMPLX Basic](notebooks/SMPLX_basic.ipynb)
6. SMPL Details
7. T.B.C.
