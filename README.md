# LearningHuman

This repository aims to provide code snippets and examples for common human motion utilities, for example, varies kinds of motion expression from skeletons to parameters models.

## Preparation

### Environment



### Data



## Usage

The support codes are placed in `lib` folder. They are mainly some utility functions for visualization or logging or something else.

All the snippets are in the jupyter notebooks under the `notebooks` folder. There are also some utility functions in the `lib` folder, but they are mainly for visualization or something else, which means they are not things you should know.

Here is the recommended order to read the notebooks if you are totally new to this field:

1. [Rotation Representation](notebooks/rotation_representation.ipynb)
2. Skeletons
3. [SMPL Basic](notebooks/SMPL_basic.ipynb)
4. SMPLH and SMPLX
5. SMPL Details
6. T.B.C.
