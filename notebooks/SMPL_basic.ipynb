    "# SMPL-basic\n",
    "\n",
    "SMPL is a classic body model for human body shape and pose estimation. We can get joints position and the vertices of mesh from SMPL's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will introduce the basic usage of `smplx.SMPL` model, a rough feeling of the four parameters, and some common problems you may encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is a \"SMPL family\", which is a set of models related to SMPL. You can have a overview of them in [SMPL wiki](https://meshcapade.wiki/SMPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we use three different checkpoints: `SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl`, `SMPL_MALE.pkl` and `SMPL_FEMALE.pkl`. You can get the first one from [SMPLify > Downloads > \"SMPLIFY_CODE_V2.ZIP\"](https://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php) and the other two from [SMPL > Downloads > \"Download version 1.0.0 for Python 2.7 (female/male. 10 shape PCs)\"](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php). Or you can choose to download them through scripts like [these lines (WHAM's script for example)](https://github.com/yohanshin/WHAM/blob/2b54f7797391c94876848b905ed875b154c4a295/fetch_demo_data.sh#L2-L30).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you download the checkpoint from the website yourself, you may get a `.pkl` file named `basicModel_neutral_lbs_10_207_0_v1.0.0.pkl` rather then `SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl`. Don't be worried, just renamed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The size of `v1.0.0` version body models is usually around 37MB. Those models support only **10** principal components for shape(betas). You can also find the `v1.1.0` version of male, female and neutral body models from [SMPL > Downloads > \"Download version 1.1.0 for Python 2.7 (female/male/neutral, 300 shape PCs)\"](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php), they are usually in the size of 247MB and support **300** principal components for shape(betas).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the SMPL's checkpoints, you should put them to `data_inputs/body_models/smpl`, your directory tree should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
